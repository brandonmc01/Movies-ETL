# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this project was to clean large sets of movie data retrieved from wikipedia and kaggle. Once the data was cleaned, I merged the two sets of data. I then merged this dataframe with a dataframe of ratings data for all movies. Finally, I exported this dataframe, as well as the raw ratings data into an SQL database.
